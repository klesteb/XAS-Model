XAS Model is Copyright (c) 2012-2023 Kevin L. Esteb 

XAS is a set of modules, procedures and practices to help write
consistent Perl5 code for a datacenter operations environment. For the most 
part, this follows the Unix tradition of small discrete components that
communicate in well defined ways.

This system is cross platform capable. It will run under Windows as well
as Unix like environments without a code rewrite. This allows you to
write your code once and run it where ever.

This package provides the database abstraction layer. It is built on the
ORM provided by DBIx::Class. There are procedures to create a database
schema, along with the ability to parse PostgreSQL backup files. 

INSTALLATION

On Unix like systems, using pure Perl, run the following commands:

    # perl Build.PL --installdirs site
    # ./Build
    # ./Build test
    # ./Build install

If you are DEB based, Debian build files have been provided. If you have a 
Debian build environment, then you can do the following:

    # debian/rules build
    # debian/rules clean
    # dpkg -i ../libxas-model-perl_0.03-1_all.deb

On Windows, do the following:

    > perl Build.PL
    > Build
    > Build test
    > Build install

It is recommended that you use Strawberry Perl, ActiveState Perl doesn't 
have all of the necessary modules available.
